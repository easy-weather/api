Easy-Weather-API-V.2
====================

Easy Weather (http://weather.keepiteasy.net/) is my pet project, and currently consists of an HTML5 Web App built in Backbone powered by an outdated PHP Rest service and a closed 3rd party Weather API. I'm re-writing this to use the free and open Yahoo Weather API, replacing PHP with Node, and repleasing the source. Enjoy!
